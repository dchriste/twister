# twister
simple Twister spinner program

I wrote this little script rather quickly to replace spinning the physical twister spinner when playing with my kids. 

Using PyDroid3 for Android, I use this script instead. Press enter to spin again; type no or exit to exit.

It provides additional features such as 
  1) spin count, 
  2) game timer, 
  3) no back-to-back spins alike, 
  4) no spins that tell you to do something you are already doing.
